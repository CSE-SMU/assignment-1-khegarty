# Assignment 1 Postmortem

## What's your past experience with front-end development?
  During Java we had a GUI based final project, and I've done small projects to work with basic GUI aspects over the past two years, very inexperienced though. 


## How difficult was this assignment?
The assignment was not difficult, although the walkthrough was very appreciated, since I've not done much in the way of html. 


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
I learned about Sublime (which had not used before) as well as Source Tree which was a huge step up from normal github pushing and pulling and much more efficient. 


## How could this assignment be improved?
This is a very good basic assignment to introduce the class, although it might be good to do some sort of walkthrough like this assignment and at the end challenge the class to come up with a more advanced or interesting version of the button push. It could cycle through 10 colors, or have 2 buttons or something like that. 


## Any other comments?
I'm excited for the new way this class is going to be taught, and looking forward to it. :D
